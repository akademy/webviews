		<h2>A big paragraph</h2>
		<p> [Dr. Zimmerman talking to his EMH]  Dr. Zimmerman: Reginald was right about you. You have exceeded the sum of your program. You've accomplished far more than I could have ever predicted. But let's face facts, you never overcame the inherent flaws in your personality subroutine. You're arrogant. Irritable. A JERK, as Counsellor Troi would say.  The Doctor: I believe she was describing you as well.  Dr. Zimmerman: Don't change the subject.
			Captain Janeway: [tapping her comm badge after the ship shakes] Janeway to Bridge.  Chakotay: We're under attack, Captain.  Captain Janeway: I'm on my way.  Leonardo da Vinci hologram: Earthquakes... and idiots.  Leonardo da Vinci hologram: Florence be damned.
			Doctor Bashir: [Shoots at Garak and inspects the injury] You'll be fine, it's just a flesh wound.  Garak: That was awfully close. What if you killed me?  Doctor Bashir: What makes you think I wasn't trying?  Garak: Doctor, I do believe there's hope for you yet.
			Chakotay: ...If Neelix has another Talent Night I hope you'll reprise it.  Captain Janeway: Oh no, not until certain other people take their turn, the ship's first officer, for instance.  Chakotay: Me, get up in front of people and perform? I don't think so.  Captain Janeway: Come on, Chakotay. There must be some talent you have that people would enjoy. Maybe I could stand with an apple on my head and you could phaser it off.  Chakotay: Sounds great. If I miss I get to be captain.
			The Doctor: You heard the man. Run along. I'll reattach any severed limbs, just don't misplace them. <a href="http://www.tvipsum.org/scifi.php">Lorem Ipsum Science Fiction</a>
