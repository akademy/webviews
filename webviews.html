  	<h1>WebViews</h1>
  	<p>An example use of WebViews. iframes of various webpages. These all exist on the same domain as this page (which means I can access the content of the iframe).</p>
  	<div id="views"></div>
	<p>The border of each view shows if it loaded correctly. There should be three green and one red on this page.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Green means load and check OK.</li>
		<li>Yellow means something loaded correctly but I can't access the iFrame due to security restrictions.</li>
		<li>Red means there was some error loading or that a check failed.</li>
		<li>Blue is used when it is loading. (At the moment websites which timeout are also shown in blue)</li>
	</ul>
